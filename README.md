# üåç Personal Web Page ‚Äì Ayb√ºke K√º√ß√ºk

## Aim
The aim of this assignment is to help students get familiar with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **OpenLayers** by designing and publishing their own personal web pages.  
This project was completed as part of the **GMT458 - Web GIS Applications** course at **Hacettepe University**.  
The main goal was not only to practice web technologies but also to gain hands-on experience in hosting and managing a website on **GitHub Pages**.

## About the Project
This project represents my journey as a **Geomatics Engineering student**.  
I designed this web page to introduce myself, share the technologies I use, and showcase some examples of my academic and technical work.

Throughout the project, I focused on:
- Clean and modern interface design  
- Simple and informative content organization  
- Integration of an **interactive OpenLayers map**  

The website is composed of the following sections:
- **About Me** ‚Äì A short introduction about my background and interests  
- **Technologies** ‚Äì A visual table of the software and tools I commonly use  
- **Projects** ‚Äì Selected projects with visuals and short explanations  
- **Contact** ‚Äì My contact information and an OpenLayers-based map

## AI Usage
I used **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** support during some parts of the project development process.  
The AI assistance mainly focused on improving the visual design and technical structure of the website.

| Topic | What I Learned |
|--------|----------------|
| CSS Table Design | How to create a clean bordered table with icons and spacing |
| Animation | How to apply fade-in and hover animations effectively |
| OpenLayers Integration | How to embed an interactive OpenLayers map into a web page |

**Estimated total AI usage:** ~ 3 hours  
> I used AI mainly when I couldn‚Äôt find a clear example or needed guidance for specific CSS or OpenLayers adjustments.
